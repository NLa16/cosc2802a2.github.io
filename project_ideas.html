        <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>When we talk about art, we usually ponder if such artistic pieces will ever be in a gallery. Thanks to the Internet and the introduction of online art galleries, any art piece will have a chance to make it. Knowing that, I have decided that my project will be a small online art gallery called WonderPaint. An online art gallery that is inspired by existing online galleries like DeviantArt, ArtStation. WonderPaint will be a gallery made for all artists to join and share their pieces, no matter the types of art or the topics they will be about.</p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>As one of the people who love and appreciate art, I find it very saddening when creators of all kinds from well-known galleries’, especially ones that have been around for a long time like DeviantArt, face common problems and struggles among artists: tracing, art theft, commission problems, and even harassment, etc. And the foundation of ArtStation (2014) does not seem to be enough, moreover, I think that we absolutely need more artist-friendly environments for artists to move to and for them to feel more comfortable to share their work. So I have decided to start out with a small and basic online art gallery. Even though it won’t be much, but it will be a great starting point for a future modern gallery.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>The core features of WonderPaint will be a website similar to DeviantArt where artists and art enthusiasts will be able to publish their pieces of art, including traditional and digital drawings, paintings, sculptures, photography, filmmaking, etc., or even literature. In order to do that, a user can create a personal account simply by choosing themselves a username and a password of choice and by providing some other basic personal information like an email address, their date of birth, and their gender, and an additional feature is that they can also choose a profile picture to express themselves. After that, with an account created, they will finally have access to publish their works. They can do that on a page where they can upload and submit their works after giving them a description of what they are about.</p>
          <p>With the publication of art pieces, artists will thrive, but they can only be able to grow the most if they receive constructive criticism. For such things to happen, a “comment section” will be added, where artists will be able to discuss their works with each other by providing feedback and criticism on one’s works.</p>
          <p>There will also be one page dedicated to all the Guidelines of the gallery, where it will probably include mostly texts about all the rules. Rules about what are deemed to be safe to publish and comment, and what are not allowed, and even ban-worthy will be included. This page will appear when a user is about to create a new account on WonderPaint to ensure that they understand their rights and responsibilities before joining in the gallery, and after they have carefully read the Guidelines, they can continue to create their own account.</p>
          <p>To ensure that everyone will follow the Guidelines in order to create a safe environment for artists to thrive, we will probably have an option to report any activities that violate the Guidelines. This applies for all contents in the website, including pictures posted and comments. This will be the core feature to protect and to prevent any harmful activities to artists alike, and a chance for them to be able to defend themselves and others.</p>
        <h2>Tools and technologies</h2>
          <p>Since WonderPaint will be published as a website, I will need some kind of software that will help me work in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScripts (JS), and the best software that I will possibly stick with will be Visual Studio Code. This software will allow me to establish a webpage by building an HTML structure and through editing how the website will look with CSS and JS coding. Not only Visual Studio Code, but some other open-source tools also will be used for the development of this webpage, including Git and possibly Bootstrap. Git (and the use of GitHub) will be very important in creating a repository and publishing the website for that repository, as well as pulling and pushing codes from the repository. Bootstrap will come in handy for references on templates and designs.</p>
        <h2>Skills required</h2>
          <p>To establish a website, the most important skills that one needs to master is definitely programming skills. Many programming languages exist, but we need to know at least a few in order to code a website, especially HTML, CSS, and JS. Secondly, users would like to look at a beautiful and neatly organized website when they visit WonderPaint, so we need basic knowledge of designing as well. We don’t need to know too much about designing, but knowing some will be essential, and a small step to get creative as well.</p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>If WonderPaint becomes successful or in my words, widely recognized, chances are I will start to develop the website more and more so lots of users can join and experience their fullest potential during their stay in the gallery. I don’t have very high hopes that my website will be successful, but if it does, it probably will create a big impact in the artist community. And I know that WonderPaint won’t be stopping there. It will continue to flourish into an art gallery where artists and art enthusiasts from all over the world can come together and enjoy art.</p>
