        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
          <p>As I have mentioned earlier, the reason that I have decided to go with a modern-day online art gallery is that I want artists and art enthusiasts alike to experience a fresh and more artist-friendly environment where they feel comfortable to display their pieces of work. However, I have realized that there will be dangerous threats to users that will most likely come from online attackers, not only from the future development of WonderPaint but also from all of the Internet. These are known as cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats come in different forms, and those are phishing, ransomware, malware, and social engineering. And when a user or an organization is attacked, they are at potential risk of having their sensitive information and data exposed, and potential loss of privacy. So cybersecurity has become vital in today’s life. What can be done now is to raise awareness for Internet users, let people know about the vitality of cybersecurity. Countries and states can hire more cybersecurity professionals as a way to upgrade and enhance the defense and offense system.</p>
          <p>In three years from now, it is most likely that cybersecurity will continue to be enhanced for defense and offense, which will create a big impact on the world of the Internet. Many things will change, and the cybersecurity defense system will experience becoming smarter and more sophisticated. Further into the future, as technology rapidly evolves, humans will eventually rely more on artificial intelligence to help us make decisions. So, this development will affect cybersecurity workers the most, since artificial intelligence will take on their duty. Thanks to this, AI development-related jobs will be made redundant.</p>
          <p>With cybersecurity, every kind of personal information that is mine, my family’s, or my friends’ will be safely protected. With security getting better, we can work and browse for goods and services on the Internet with less fear of having our personal information leaked and stolen by hackers.</p>
        <h2>Chatterbots</h2>
          <p>Some people would find it difficult to understand a feature in the webpage (well, not just WonderPaint but also many other pages) so they might need assistance from the administrator. But then, where will they get help if the administrator is not available as well? Well, I have come up with an idea of implementing a chatterbot to WonderPaint to help answer users’ various questions whenever the administrator is away.</p>
          <p>Although it is a new feature that only made its appearance lately, I can see great potential in developing a chatbot because in the near future, it is very possible that each person will have a chatbot assistant that will help them in their everyday life. More and more businesses are starting to use chatbots as well, because it provides 24/7 service and it is great at acquiring customers’ information. As same as cybersecurity, the future of chatbot relies on artificial intelligence. AI developers will be able to build more complex chatbots that can have more valuable interactions with customers and meet the changing needs of them. Thus, increasing the efficiency of both customers and agents benefits.</p>
          <p>With the strong development of chatbots, I and those around me can finally interact with them and have easy answers to my questions. The capability of chatbots can prove that they could be enhanced to meet customer expectations and increase customer satisfaction and engagement.</p>
